Erl4j provides a framework for creating Java servers that can respond to Erlang RPC messages. 

Dependencies:
 * jsvc 1.0.1 (http://commons.apache.org/daemon/jsvc.html)
 * Jinterface 1.5.1 (part of Erlang/OTP)
 * Rake 0.8.7
 
Erl4j may work with other versions of those dependencies, but those are just the ones I've tested it in.

To use Erl4j, you just have to implement the Erl4j abstract class, specifically the respond method. See sample/com/syntacticbayleaves/erl4j/SampleErl4j.java
